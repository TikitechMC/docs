# 🏡 Getting Started

## Intro
Welcome to the Sunscreen documentation. First of all, thanks for purchasing this plugin, or even just for your interest! 
This 

# 📥 First install
Just like any plugin, Sunscreen can be installed by putting it in the ``/plugins/`` folder.  
Sunscreen will generate the needed files on startup, this includes the config and the default storage method ([File Storage](/docs/config/storage)).

The purchased version of Sunscreen includes two default menus, which can be accessed with the [open menu](/docs/command) command.

# Setup
Sunscreen guides you through the setup through chat (everyone with the right permission/OP will get a notification). It can automatically merge its resource pack with Nexo and ItemsAdder or ask you to upload and adjust your own vanilla pack.
